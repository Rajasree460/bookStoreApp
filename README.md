# bookStoreApp
I built a book store app where:

Unsigned users see only free books.

Course page is hidden for unsigned users; they see the signup page instead.

Signed-up users can access the course page.

Anyone can send messages through the contact page.

About page is open to all.

It has dark & light mode.

Logged-in users see a logout button; unsigned users see login/sign-up.
